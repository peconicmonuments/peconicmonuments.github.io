#### *From A Marker To A Mausoleum - Your Full Service Memorial Shop*

At George Hill Moore Peconic Monument Works we take pride in offering
our customers help through a possibly difficult and painful time of
dealing with the loss of a loved one.  The Warners remain sensitive to
the families' wishes and needs, and patiently work with the family to
help guide them through the many decisions in choosing a cemetery
monument.

Most people purchase a memorial once, or perhaps twice in a lifetime. Because
such purchases are made infrequently, it is understandable difficult for a
person to be thoroughly familiar with the main factors that influence the
quality and value of memorials.  The professional counsel offered by Peconic
Monument Works will enable you to make your selection with full confidence.

Peconic Monument Works can help you choose a memorial that remembers and honors
your loved one.  The price of the memorial depends upon the material used, its
color, shape, size, design, lettering, and personalization. Some of the
services and products we offer are listed below:

* [Memorials](#memorials)

## Memorials

Our motto is "From a Marker to a Mausoleum", meaning that we can help you with
the need of matching an existing family marker at the cemetery plot, or in
designing a beautiful memorial that will honor and commemorate the life of a
loved one forever.

At Peconic Monument Works, we work with families to bring their
memorial vision to life.  We offer several different colors of
granite in addition to marble. We specialize in the simplest of flat
markers to the most elaborate monuments with carvings or etchings, and
mausoleums.

Peconic Monuments is a full service memorial shop, meaning that in
addition to working with families to bring their memorial vision to
life, we also communicate with the cemetery on the family's behalf, and
install the completed memorial in the cemetery.

We are here to help you every step of the way in choosing the perfect
tribute for your loved one. It is our mission to come along side you in
this time of need and to make this process as easy and encouraging as
possible. We promise to provide attentive, caring service at a fair
price. Nationwide shipping is available.


## Bronze Plaques

Sometimes plaques are made to be placed at a memorial park or planted tree, or
sometimes they are set on an existing native stone or boulder.  We offer many
different ideas and there are many different sizes of bronze plaques to choose
from. All bronze plaques are custom cast to size, design, and lettering
requests.


## Civic Memorials

## Granite Vases

Peconic Monument Works has an extensive range of Memorial vases,
Memorial plaques, engraved plaques, pet plaques, Memorial headstones,
gravestones and grave memorials suitable for all types of bereavement
including child/children's, churchyards, cemeteries, personal and pets
/animal memorial.

When looking for cemetery flower vases, there are many styles, colors
and designs available. First and foremost, you will want a cemetery
flower holder that is durable and will withstand any type of weather
condition. You want your loved one's headstone to look nice for honor
and remembrance. Placing a strong vase will ensure that you will keep
the grave site looking beautiful.

Deciding on a container for someone who has died is difficult, but you
want to show your continued love through the beauty of flowers. When
choosing a vase you want to find the perfect one. Think about what your
deceased loved one would like as well as what you think would look nice
with the headstone.

Granite/marble vases: Granite and marble cemetery vases will remain
appearing new through the elements. These flower vases are usually
built right into the headstone or can be added afterwards if there is
enough room for them on the base or side of the headstone. They can
come in light or dark stone colors or different colored marble to match
the headstone.



## Cleaning Services

We offer services in the field of cleaning memorials. We do cleaning on
site at the cemetery, and remove lichen, dirt, moss, mold, algae, and
air pollutants.


## Cemetery Corner Posts

Corner posts can be lettered with the family initial(s) or with a
design. They mark the four corners of a cemetery plot and can be
installed flush with the ground or cemetery permitting, above ground.


## Granite Cemetery Benches

Granite benches can be a nice enhancement to your loved one's plot. In
some cases, a granite bench can even serve as the permanant monument.
Granite benches can also be carved or lettered to commemorate
individuals or donors.


## Inscription Lettering

*(Names and/or years added to an existing monument, without removing the
monument or disturbing the grave.)*

If you already have a monument or marker on your plot, and just need to
add a name or date for a loved one who has passed, we will add these
inscriptions to your memorial. We will check your stone for you in the
cemetery prior to doing the work to ensure that the new lettering will
match the existing in terms of size and font.  At Peconic Monument
Works, we guarantee all of our work to ensure you are pleased with the
results.

If you are looking to have information added to an existing memorial,
we have our team go on site to the cemetery and add the lettering at
the time of need.  Prior to doing the inscription, we would go see the
existing memorial to ensure we match the existing lettering size and
font. Below are examples of what can be added to a memorial after it
has already been set in a cemetery;

- Names
- Years/dates of birth or passing
- Carvings/designs
- Epitaphs


## Mausoleums
