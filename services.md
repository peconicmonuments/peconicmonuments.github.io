Your Full Service Memorial Shop

From A Marker To A Mausoleum

At George Hill Moore Peconic Monument Works we take pride in offering
our customers help through a possibly difficult and painful time of
dealing with the loss of a loved one.  The Warners remain sensitive to
the families' wishes and needs, and patiently work with the family to
help guide them through the many decisions in choosing a cemetery
monument.

Most people purchase a memorial once, or perhaps twice in a lifetime.
Because such purchases are made infrequently, it is understandable
difficult for a person to be thoroughly familiar with the main factors
that influence the quality and value of memorials.  The professional
counsel offered by Peconic Monument Works will enable you to make your
selection with full confidence.

Peconic Monument Works can help you choose a memorial that remembers
and honors your loved one.  The price of the memorial depends upon the
material used, its color, shape, size, design, lettering, and
personalization.

Some of the services and products we offer are listed below.

 * Memorials- Our motto is "From a Marker to a Mausoleum", meaning
   that we can help you with the need of matching an existing family
   marker at the cemetery plot, or in designing a beautiful memorial

 * [25]Bronze plaques - Sometimes plaques are made to be placed at a

## Pet Memorials

Having a memorial made for your pet can be a special way to commemorate
their life and valued companionship. If you are interested in a
