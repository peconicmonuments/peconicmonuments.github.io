George Hill Moore Peconic Monument Works was started in 1842 as Frank
H. Hill and Brother.  Frank Hill and his brother, Lester, ran a marble
and granite works business in a rambling wood structure at the corner
of Griffing Avenue and Main Street in Riverhead.  Sometime during the
1920's the property and the building were divided, and the existing
monument building is the north portion of that older structure.
Frank and Lester's sister's son, George Hill Moore, worked for his
uncles from his youth. George took over the business from his uncles.
Later his two sons, Robert and Russell Moore, worked with their father,
and eventually took over the business from their dad, George Moore.

Russ and Bob Moore sold it to John Warner in August 1982. John and his
wife, Shirley Warner ran the business until January 1989, at which time
John died after a brief illness. The business was carried on by John's
wife, Shirley and her son, Hollis until October 1992. At that time,
Hollis bought it from Shirley, and operated the business along with his
wife, Paula.  In June of 2014, Hollis and Paula's son John, along with
his wife Ashley, moved up from Florida to begin working at the business
as well.

Whew, if you can follow that history, we give you a lot of credit! We
are honored and privileged to be carrying on one of the oldest
businesses on Long Island.
