Memorials

At Peconic Monument Works, we work with families to bring their
memorial vision to life.  We offer several different colors of
granite in addition to marble. We specialize in the simplest of flat
markers to the most elaborate monuments with carvings or etchings, and
mausoleums.

Peconic Monuments is a full service memorial shop, meaning that in
addition to working with families to bring their memorial vision to
life, we also communicate with the cemetery on the family's behalf, and
install the completed memorial in the cemetery.

We are here to help you every step of the way in choosing the perfect
tribute for your loved one. It is our mission to come along side you in
this time of need and to make this process as easy and encouraging as
possible. We promise to provide attentive, caring service at a fair
price. Nationwide shipping is available.
