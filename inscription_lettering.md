Inscription lettering

[stone-lettering.jpg]

If you already have a monument or marker on your plot, and just need to
add a name or date for a loved one who has passed, we will add these
inscriptions to your memorial. We will check your stone for you in the
cemetery prior to doing the work to ensure that the new lettering will
match the existing in terms of size and font.  At Peconic Monument
Works, we guarantee all of our work to ensure you are pleased with the
results.

If you are looking to have information added to an existing memorial,
we have our team go on site to the cemetery and add the lettering at
the time of need.  Prior to doing the inscription, we would go see the
existing memorial to ensure we match the existing lettering size and
font. Below are examples of what can be added to a memorial after it
has already been set in a cemetery;

-Names

-Years/dates of birth or passing

-Carvings/designs

-Epitaphs
